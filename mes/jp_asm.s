@@ This is also a comment. Some people use double @@ symbols.
.code 16 @ This directive selects the instruction set being generated.
@ The value 16 selects Thumb, with the value 32 selecting ARM.
.text @ Tell the assembler that the upcoming section is to be considered
@ assembly language instructions - Code section (text -> ROM)
@@ Function Header Block
.align 2 @ Code alignment - 2^n alignment (n=2)
@ This causes the assembler to use 4 byte alignment
.syntax unified @ Sets the instruction set to the new unified ARM + THUMB
@ instructions. The default is divided (separate instruction sets)
.global add_test @ Make the symbol name for the function visible to the linker
.code 16 @ 16bit THUMB code (BOTH .code and .thumb_func are required)
.thumb_func @ Specifies that the following symbol is the name of a THUMB

@ encoded function. Necessary for interlinking between ARM and THUMB code.
.type add_test, %function @ Declares that the symbol is a function (not strictly required)
@ Function Declaration : int add_test(int x, int y)
@
@ Input: r0, r1 (i.e. r0 holds x, r1 holds y)
@ Returns: r0

@ Here is the actual add_test function
add_test:
push {lr}
add r0, r0, r1
mov r0, #3
bl BSP_LED_Toggle
mov r0, r2
bl busy_delay
pop {lr}
bx lr @ Return (Branch eXchange) to the address in the link register (lr)
.size add_test, .-add_test @@ - symbol size (not strictly required, but makes the debugger happy)


@ Function Declaration : int busy_delay(int cycles)
@
@ Input: r0 (i.e. r0 holds number of cycles to delay)
@ Returns: r0

@ Here is the actual function. DO NOT MODIFY THIS FUNCTION.
busy_delay:
push {r5}
mov r5, r0
delay_1oop:
subs r5, r5, #1
bge delay_1oop
mov r0, #0 @ Return zero (success)
pop {r5}
